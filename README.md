# Overview

THis is a test application learning how arcGIS works and all of it's capabilities

This software maps out all of the meeting houses for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around Rexburg Idaho. I searched the address and coordinates for each meetinghouse and put it into a JSON file to be read out of

I build this software to test out arcGIS and what it is capable of doing

# Development Environment

I used HTML and javascript in order to complete this assignment. I also used JSON in order to save a list of each place marked out on the map. I used argGIS to create the map and used built in graphic capabilities to draw the points on the map
