# Overview

THis is a test application learning how arcGIS works and all of it's capabilities, as well as implementing a firebase database

This software maps out all of the meeting houses for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around Rexburg Idaho. I searched the address and coordinates for each meetinghouse and entered the information into a database that is used by the software

I build this software to test out arcGIS and what it is capable of doing

# Development Environment

I used HTML and javascript in order to complete this assignment. I also used JSON in order to save a list of each place marked out on the map. I used argGIS to create the map and used built in graphic capabilities to draw the points on the map. I used Firebase databases to save the GPS coordinate data and the address information to the location so that the software can pull everything from the database

# Future Work

* Ability to delete locations
* Pop up with information about each location
* Additional information for each location
